\label{chapter:experiment}
The experiment environment consists of two clusters: compute cluster and Kafka cluster. Computer cluster consists of 8 work nodes and one master nodes. Kafka cluster has 5 brokers with one zookeeper instance running on the same machine with one Kafka broker. Each above node is a visual machine which has 4 CPU and 15 GB RAM. All the nodes are in the same local area network that provides low latency and high throughput connectivity.
